//if statement
 The if statement is used to execute a code block conditionally.  It surrounds a code 
block, and that block will only be entered when the condition in the if statement 
evaluates to true.
syntax:
 if (boolean_expression1)
 {
 // One or more lines of code.
 } 
                             
else                         
  // OPTIONAL
 {                              
// Yet more lines of code.
 }     //

// The while loop checks a condition before entering the loop, then executes the loop block 
if the condition is true. The condition must be a boolean expression contained in 
parentheses like the if statement. The syntax for the while loop is as follows:
 while (boolean_expression)
 {
 // loop block
 }//
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 145;
        int original = num;
        int i = 2;

        while (num % i == 0) {
            num = num / i;
            i++;
        }

        if (num == 1) {
            System.out.println(original + " is a factorial of " + (i - 1) + "!");
        } else {
            System.out.println(original + " is NOT a factorial of any integer.");
        }
    }
}
